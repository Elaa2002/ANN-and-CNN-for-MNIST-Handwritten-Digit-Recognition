# ANN-and-CNN-for-MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project implements a digit classification system using the MNIST dataset, showcasing both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from 28x28 grayscale images and compare the performance of different neural architectures.It includes model training, evaluation, and visualization, all developed in Python using TensorFlow/Keras.
