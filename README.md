# ANN-and-CNN-for-MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project implements a digit classification system using the MNIST dataset, showcasing both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) from 28x28 grayscale images and compare the performance of different neural architectures.
